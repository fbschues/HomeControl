# HomeControl
Collecting data in my home for analyse and controlling
Ther are a lot of measuring data in a home availble or existing but not measured.
My intention is to change this mess.
1. getting a gateway for the OpenTherm connection boiler-thermostat. ->done
1.a looking for a WiFi connection to this otgw -> under construction (UNO-ESP8266)
2. Installing HomeController -> HomeMatic CCU2, RPi PiVCCU, Thinker-S ioBroker -> on work
3. set up a BananaPi-R3 as server -> on work
lets see how it goes on... :-)FBS
